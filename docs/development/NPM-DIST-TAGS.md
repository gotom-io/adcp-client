# npm Dist-Tags

`@adcp/sdk` uses `latest` for the current stable SDK line. Users should be able
to run `npm install @adcp/sdk` or `npx @adcp/sdk` and receive the supported
stable release.

Older supported protocol lines may also have explicit AdCP compatibility
dist-tags:

- `adcp-3.0` for the newest SDK runner/schema bundle in the AdCP 3.0 line.
- `adcp-3.1` only if AdCP 3.1 becomes a maintenance line after a newer stable
  protocol line opens.

Compatibility tags are long-lived CI targets. They should move forward within a
protocol minor line, but should not move across protocol minor lines. For
example, Python SDK CI can pin `@adcp/sdk@adcp-3.0` without being moved when
another compatibility line opens.

Do not use bare `3.0`, `3.1`, or `3.2` as npm dist-tags. npm rejects those tag
names because it parses them as semver ranges.

## Release Automation

The release workflow publishes with `npm publish --tag latest` via
`npm run release`. `latest` intentionally tracks the default stable SDK release,
not a branch name.

Set `ADCP_NPM_TAG` only when intentionally publishing a maintenance or alternate
channel, for example `ADCP_NPM_TAG=adcp-3.0 npm run release`.

This is intentionally a publish-time tag, not a post-publish `npm dist-tag add`.
npm trusted publishing via GitHub OIDC authenticates `npm publish`, so the
chosen tag works without a long-lived npm token. Post-publish dist-tag mutation
is a separate registry operation and is not covered by OIDC. Emergency retags can
still be repaired manually with `npm dist-tag add`, but normal releases should
not need a registry token.

Changesets pre-mode normally uses the pre-mode tag for both the npm dist-tag and
the semver prerelease identifier. The release wrapper keeps that pre-mode tag
unless `ADCP_NPM_TAG` is set. That prevents prereleases from moving `latest`
accidentally.
