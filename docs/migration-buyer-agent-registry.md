# Migrating to `BuyerAgentRegistry`

## tl;dr

If you're on `@adcp/sdk` 6.x today and don't wire an `agentRegistry`, **nothing changes for you**. Skip this guide until you're ready to add buyer-agent identity to your seller.

If you want the durable identity surface — opt in via three additions:

1. Build a `BuyerAgent` record per onboarded buyer agent (in your DB or in-memory map keyed by `credential.key_id`).
2. Wrap a `BuyerAgentRegistry.signingOnly` / `bearerOnly` / `mixed` factory in `BuyerAgentRegistry.cached(...)`.
3. Set `agentRegistry` on your `DecisioningPlatform`.

The framework picks up the registry, runs `resolve()` once per request, threads the resolved record through `ctx.agent`, gates `suspended`/`blocked` agents at 403, and enforces `sync_accounts.billing` against `BuyerAgent.billing_capabilities`. See [the worked reference adapter](../examples/hello_signals_adapter_marketplace.ts) for the full wiring.

## What's included

| Feature | Purpose | Adopter-visible? |
|---|---|---|
| `BuyerAgentRegistry` Protocol + 3 factories | Map credentials to durable buyer-agent records | Opt in via `platform.agentRegistry` |
| `BuyerAgent.status` enforcement | Reject `suspended`/`blocked` agents at 403 | Active when registry returns a record |
| `ResolvedAuthInfo.credential` (kind-discriminated) | Stable identity surface across api-key / OAuth / signed-request auth | Opt in by reading `ctx.authInfo.credential.kind` |
| Verifier-attested `http_sig.agent_url` | Cryptographic proof of buyer-agent identity (per adcp#3831) | Active with `verifySignatureAsAuthenticator` or auto-wired `signedRequests.agentUrlForKeyid` |
| `BuyerAgentRegistry.cached` decorator | TTL + LRU + concurrent-resolve coalescing + `invalidate()` / `clear()` API | Decorator pattern — wrap your registry |
| `BuyerAgent.sandbox_only` (Phase 1.5) | Defense-in-depth for test agents | Set on the agent record; framework gates after `accounts.resolve` |
| `sync_accounts` billing gate | Reject billing values outside the resolved agent's commercial relationship | Active when `platform.agentRegistry` returns a record |
| Credential pattern redactor | Scrub bearer tokens / labeled creds / URL basic-auth / long token-shaped strings from `error.details.reason` | Active for all 6 dispatcher error-projection sites |

## Billing Enforcement

When `sync_accounts.accounts[]` carries a provisioning `billing` value, the framework now applies the AdCP 3.1 commercial gates before calling `accounts.upsert`:

- Values outside `capabilities.supportedBillings` return a per-account `BILLING_NOT_SUPPORTED` row with `details.scope: "capability"` and a `supported_billing` echo.
- Values allowed by the seller but not by `ctx.agent.billing_capabilities` return `BILLING_NOT_PERMITTED_FOR_AGENT` with clamped details: `rejected_billing` plus one optional `suggested_billing`.
- If an `agentRegistry` is configured but the bearer/API-key/OAuth credential does not map to a `BuyerAgent`, the framework returns `BILLING_NOT_SUPPORTED` and omits `details.scope` to avoid an onboarding oracle.
- If `capabilities.supportedPaymentTerms` is set, unsupported `payment_terms` return `PAYMENT_TERMS_NOT_SUPPORTED`.

Rejected rows are filtered out before `accounts.upsert`; accepted rows still reach your handler and are merged back into the original response order. Billing and payment-term rejection rows are intentionally not cached by the idempotency replay layer, so an onboarding or capability change can take effect on the buyer's next retry with the same key.

Use `BuyerAgentRegistry.suggestBilling(ctx.agent.billing_capabilities, rejected)` when you need to mirror the framework's single-suggestion policy in adopter code.

## Decision tree: do I need to change anything?

| Your situation | What to do |
|---|---|
| 6.x adopter, no plans to identify buyer agents | Nothing. Continue using `ctx.authInfo.token` as before. |
| 6.x adopter using `ctx.authInfo.token` / `clientId` / `scopes` | Keep working — fields are deprecated but populated. Plan migration to `credential.kind` over the next two minors. |
| Custom `authenticate()` callback returning `{ principal, token, scopes }` | Keep working. To opt into registry routing, ALSO populate `credential` on the returned `AuthPrincipal` (kind-discriminated). |
| Adopter who wants to register buyer agents | Build the `BuyerAgentRegistry` per § "Wiring the registry" below. |
| Adopter running test/CI agents | Set `BuyerAgent.sandbox_only: true` on test agents AND have your `accounts.resolve` return `sandbox: true` on test accounts. See § "sandbox_only" below. |
| Adopter with `verifySignatureAsAuthenticator` already wired | Configure the verifier's `agentUrlForKeyid` callback. Without it, `http_sig` credentials are stamped without `agent_url`, the registry returns null on the signed path, and you fall back to bearer behavior. |

## Deprecation cycle: `ResolvedAuthInfo.{token, clientId, scopes}`

Phase 1 Stage 3 added a kind-discriminated `credential` field on `ResolvedAuthInfo` and tagged the legacy fields `@deprecated`. Two-minor cycle:

| Release | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **N (current)** | Legacy fields populated as before. New `credential?: AdcpCredential` populated by built-in authenticators. Both work simultaneously. |
| N+1 | Framework warns once per process when adopter `authenticate()` returns the legacy shape without `credential`. Runtime behavior unchanged. |
| N+2 | Legacy fields removed. Adopters MUST populate `credential` on returned `AuthPrincipal`. |

### How to migrate handler reads

```ts
// Before — legacy shape
async resolveAccount(ref, { authInfo }) {
  const clientId = authInfo?.clientId;
  // ...
}

// After — kind-discriminated
async resolveAccount(ref, { authInfo }) {
  const credential = authInfo?.credential;
  if (credential?.kind === 'oauth') {
    const clientId = credential.client_id;
    // ...
  } else if (credential?.kind === 'api_key') {
    const keyId = credential.key_id; // sha256 hash, NOT the raw token
    // ...
  } else if (credential?.kind === 'http_sig') {
    const agentUrl = credential.agent_url; // verifier-attested
    // ...
  }
}
```

### `agent_url` reads: verified vs. registry-derived

If your handler reads `agent_url` for security decisions (mutating-tool authorization, brand-side authz), read from `credential.agent_url` (only available when `credential.kind === 'http_sig'`). Verified by the framework's signature verifier per adcp#3831.

If you want the registry's view of who the agent is (display name, status, billing capabilities), read from `ctx.agent` (the resolved `BuyerAgent` record). NOT cryptographically verified — it's whatever the registry's `resolveByCredential` returned.

```ts
// Verified identity (security-relevant — http_sig only)
if (ctx.authInfo?.credential?.kind === 'http_sig') {
  const verifiedAgentUrl = ctx.authInfo.credential.agent_url;
}

// Registry identity (informational — across all credential kinds)
const buyerAgent = ctx.agent;
const displayName = buyerAgent?.display_name;
```

## Wiring the registry

### 1. Build your onboarding ledger

Production: a Postgres table keyed by `credential.key_id` (or `credential.agent_url` for signed-only deployments). The seller stores the **hash** of the api token, not the raw token — see § "Credential issuance" below.

```ts
import { createHash } from 'node:crypto';
import type { BuyerAgent } from '@adcp/sdk/server';

function hashApiKey(token: string): string {
  return createHash('sha256').update(token).digest('hex').slice(0, 32);
}

// Production: replace with a DB query.
const ONBOARDING_LEDGER = new Map<string, BuyerAgent>([
  [hashApiKey('sk_partner_dsp_xyz'), {
    agent_url: 'https://partner-dsp.example.com',
    display_name: 'Partner DSP',
    status: 'active',
    billing_capabilities: new Set(['operator', 'agent']),
  }],
  [hashApiKey('sk_test_harness'), {
    agent_url: 'https://addie.example.com',
    display_name: 'Test harness',
    status: 'active',
    billing_capabilities: new Set(['operator']),
    sandbox_only: true,  // see § "sandbox_only" below
  }],
]);
```

### 2. Pick a registry posture

Three factories encode the implementer posture at construction:

| Factory | When to use |
|---|---|
| `BuyerAgentRegistry.signingOnly({ resolveByAgentUrl })` | Production target. Only HTTP-Sig credentials resolve; bearer/API-key/OAuth refused at the registry layer. Cleanest long-term. |
| `BuyerAgentRegistry.bearerOnly({ resolveByCredential })` | Pre-trust beta. All credential kinds route through your mapping; signed traffic is treated the same as bearer. |
| `BuyerAgentRegistry.mixed({ resolveByAgentUrl, resolveByCredential })` | Transition. Signed credentials resolve cryptographically (preferred); bearer falls through to your legacy key table. |

```ts
import { BuyerAgentRegistry } from '@adcp/sdk/server';

const registry = BuyerAgentRegistry.cached(
  BuyerAgentRegistry.bearerOnly({
    resolveByCredential: async credential => {
      // bearerOnly receives every credential kind; MUST kind-discriminate
      // and reject anything you don't recognize.
      if (credential.kind !== 'api_key') return null;
      return ONBOARDING_LEDGER.get(credential.key_id) ?? null;
    },
  }),
  { ttlSeconds: 60 }
);
```

### 3. Wire it on your platform

```ts
class MyPlatform implements DecisioningPlatform<MyConfig, MyMeta> {
  // ... existing fields ...

  agentRegistry = registry;
}
```

That's it. The framework runs `agentRegistry.resolve(authInfo)` on every request after auth and before `accounts.resolve`. The resolved `BuyerAgent` is on `ctx.agent`; status enforcement (`suspended`/`blocked` → 403) and `sync_accounts.billing` enforcement fire automatically.

### Three implementer postures, summarized

```ts
// Production target — bearer/OAuth refused at the registry layer
BuyerAgentRegistry.signingOnly({
  resolveByAgentUrl: async (agent_url) => db.findByAgentUrl(agent_url),
});

// Pre-trust beta — all credential kinds via adopter mapping
BuyerAgentRegistry.bearerOnly({
  resolveByCredential: async (credential) => db.findByKeyId(credential),
});

// Transition (during bearer→signed migration)
BuyerAgentRegistry.mixed({
  resolveByAgentUrl: async (agent_url) => db.findByAgentUrl(agent_url),
  resolveByCredential: async (credential) => db.findByKeyId(credential),
});
```

## Credential issuance (the part the framework doesn't model)

Every seller needs an admin flow to onboard buyer agents. The framework doesn't ship one — that's adopter-side work. The contract:

1. Seller's admin UI / API generates a fresh bearer token (32+ bytes of CSPRNG entropy).
2. Compute `hashApiKey(token)` to get the `key_id` that `verifyApiKey` will stamp on every request.
3. Insert a `BuyerAgent` row into your ledger keyed by that `key_id`.
4. Hand the raw token to the buyer agent **out-of-band** (signed contract, secure delivery). The token is the credential; the ledger only stores the hash, so a leak of the ledger doesn't yield a usable credential.
5. Subsequent requests carry `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; the framework hashes, looks up the row, and threads the resolved `BuyerAgent` through `ctx.agent`.

For rotation: issue a new token with a new `key_id`, leave the old one valid for a grace window, then call `registry.invalidate(oldCredential)` and drop the old row from the ledger.

## Caching: `BuyerAgentRegistry.cached(...)`

Always wrap your registry in the cache decorator unless you have a specific reason not to. Defaults are sensible (60s TTL, 10000-entry LRU, no null caching).

```ts
const registry = BuyerAgentRegistry.cached(inner, {
  ttlSeconds: 60,           // default
  cacheNullsTtlSeconds: 0,  // default — recognize newly-onboarded agents within one request
  maxSize: 10000,           // default — bounded against credential-spam attacks
});

// Invalidate when you mutate the agent's record:
registry.invalidate(credential);

// Or clear everything (e.g., daily reset, migration):
registry.clear();
```

**Stale-status window.** TTL bounds how long a `'suspended'` or `'blocked'` flip takes to propagate. For sellers needing instant propagation, either set a short TTL or call `registry.invalidate(credential)` when you mutate the row.

**Negative cache.** Default `cacheNullsTtlSeconds: 0` means freshly-onboarded agents are recognized within one request. Enable null caching only if you understand the [timing-oracle implication](#) (an unauthenticated prober can infer "this credential was probed recently" from hit-vs-miss latency).

## `sandbox_only`: defense-in-depth for test agents

Test agents (CI runners, internal QA agents, partner pre-prod environments) shouldn't have production reach. If a test credential leaks, blast radius should be bounded to sandbox accounts.

```ts
// On the BuyerAgent record:
{
  agent_url: 'https://test-harness.example.com',
  display_name: 'CI test agent',
  status: 'active',
  billing_capabilities: new Set(['operator']),
  sandbox_only: true,  // ← the load-bearing field
}
```

**Load-bearing pair.** For a sandbox-only agent to admit ANY traffic, your `accounts.resolve` MUST return `sandbox: true` on the matching accounts. Mismatches produce `PERMISSION_DENIED + scope: 'agent' + reason: 'sandbox-only'` on every request — failure is loud, not silent.

```ts
// In accounts.resolve:
return {
  id: account.id,
  // ...
  sandbox: account.is_sandbox,  // your real sandbox flag from the backing store
};
```

The worked example at [`examples/hello_signals_adapter_marketplace.ts`](../examples/hello_signals_adapter_marketplace.ts) demonstrates this end-to-end with Addie (the storyboard runner) marked `sandbox_only: true`.

## Custom `authenticate()` callbacks

Adopters with custom auth (not using `verifyApiKey` / `verifyBearer` / `verifySignatureAsAuthenticator`) need to populate `credential` on the returned `AuthPrincipal` to opt into registry routing.

```ts
// Before — legacy shape
serve(createAgent, {
  authenticate: async (req) => {
    const token = extractFromCustomHeader(req);
    const principal = await myCustomLookup(token);
    return principal ? { principal: principal.id, token, scopes: [] } : null;
  },
});

// After — populate `credential` to opt into the registry
import { createHash } from 'node:crypto';

serve(createAgent, {
  authenticate: async (req) => {
    const token = extractFromCustomHeader(req);
    const principal = await myCustomLookup(token);
    if (!principal) return null;
    return {
      principal: principal.id,
      token,
      scopes: [],
      // Stamp the kind-discriminated credential so BuyerAgentRegistry
      // can route on it. Use the same sha256 hash the framework's
      // verifyApiKey would use, so adopters mixing custom and built-in
      // authenticators key off the same key_id.
      credential: {
        kind: 'api_key',
        key_id: createHash('sha256').update(token).digest('hex').slice(0, 32),
      },
    };
  },
});
```

Custom callbacks that don't populate `credential` see `BuyerAgentRegistry.resolve` return `null` → `ctx.agent` stays undefined → framework's request flow is unchanged.

## Verifier-side: `verifySignatureAsAuthenticator`

If you're using HTTP-Sig auth, configure the verifier's `agentUrlForKeyid` callback so the framework can stamp `credential.agent_url`:

```ts
import { verifySignatureAsAuthenticator } from '@adcp/sdk/server';

const auth = verifySignatureAsAuthenticator({
  capability,
  jwks,
  resolveOperation: mcpToolNameResolver,
  // CONFIGURE THIS: maps the verified keyid back to the agent_url it
  // belongs to. The verifier stamps `credential.agent_url` from this
  // lookup; without it, the http_sig credential is omitted (no
  // agent_url available) and BuyerAgentRegistry.signingOnly returns
  // null on every signed request.
  agentUrlForKeyid: (keyid) => keyidToAgentUrlMap.get(keyid),
});
```

Per adcp#3831, the `agent_url` derivation rule is "the `agents[]` entry whose `jwks_uri` resolved the keyid." Your `agentUrlForKeyid` MUST follow this — don't return arbitrary URLs.

### Auto-wired `signedRequests`

Servers using `createAdcpServer({ signedRequests })` can expose the same
verified identity without separately wiring `verifySignatureAsAuthenticator`:

```ts
createAdcpServer({
  // ...platform configuration...
  signedRequests: {
    jwks,
    replayStore,
    revocationStore,
    agentUrlForKeyid: (keyid) => keyidToAgentUrlMap.get(keyid),
    // Optional: map the signer to your stable internal principal.
    makePrincipal: (signer) => {
      const principal = keyidToPrincipal.get(signer.keyid);
      if (!principal) throw new Error('Unknown signer key');
      return { principal };
    },
  },
});
```

`makePrincipal` must return a non-empty principal; an unmapped key is rejected.
If `serve({ authenticate })` is also configured, the signer and authenticate
hook must resolve to the same principal or the request is rejected with 401.
This prevents bearer scopes/task ownership from being combined with a
different signed buyer-agent identity.

## Common pitfalls

### "I added the registry but `ctx.agent` is always undefined"

Three usual causes:
1. **No `credential` populated.** Custom `authenticate()` returns the legacy shape without `credential`. → Stamp `credential` on the returned `AuthPrincipal` (see § "Custom `authenticate()` callbacks").
2. **`signingOnly` registry but bearer auth.** `signingOnly` refuses non-`http_sig` credentials. → Use `bearerOnly` or `mixed`, OR migrate to `verifySignatureAsAuthenticator`.
3. **Resolver returns `null`.** Your DB doesn't have the credential's `key_id` / `agent_url`. → Check that the seed data in your onboarding ledger is keyed off the same hash the framework computes (sha256 hex prefix, 32 chars).

### "All my requests 403 with `reason: 'sandbox-only'`"

You set `sandbox_only: true` on a buyer agent but your `accounts.resolve` doesn't return `sandbox: true` on the resolved Account. The gate composes `agent.sandbox_only && account.sandbox !== true → reject`. Either:
- Drop `sandbox_only: true` from the agent record (production agent), OR
- Have your resolver populate `sandbox: true` on the account it resolves (sandbox account).

### "verifySignatureAsAuthenticator is wired but `signingOnly` returns null"

The verifier needs an `agentUrlForKeyid` callback to stamp `credential.agent_url`. Without it, the credential is omitted and the registry has nothing to look up. See § "Verifier-side" above.

### "I'm getting `AGENT_SUSPENDED` on a buyer I just unsuspended"

The cache is serving the stale `status: 'suspended'` for up to `ttlSeconds`. Call `registry.invalidate(credential)` after you mutate the row, OR set a shorter TTL.

> Note: as of AdCP 3.1 (adcp#3906), suspended/blocked agents are rejected with dedicated codes `AGENT_SUSPENDED` / `AGENT_BLOCKED` instead of the 3.0.5 placeholder `PERMISSION_DENIED + details.scope: 'agent' + details.status: 'suspended' | 'blocked'`. Recovery is `terminal` for both — re-onboarding lifts the status at the seller, not on the wire.
