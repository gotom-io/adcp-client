/**
 * Pins the members added for the transactional reporting notification path as
 * optional, so an implementation written against an earlier release still
 * satisfies the published interfaces.
 *
 * This lives in a compiled fixture on purpose. The equivalent assertion in a
 * `test/**\/*.js` file is inert: those files are outside every TypeScript
 * config, so making either member required would not fail anything. Here it is
 * a compile error.
 *
 * The `.type-test.ts` suffix is load-bearing. `tsconfig.json` excludes
 * `**\/*.test.ts`, which needs a literal `.test.ts`; the hyphen in
 * `-test.ts` means this file — like the twenty-one fixtures beside it — is
 * resolved into the program. Verified with TypeScript's own
 * `parseJsonConfigFileContent`: all 22 files in this directory appear in
 * `fileNames`, none are excluded.
