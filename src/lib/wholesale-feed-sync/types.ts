 * and the documented `applies_to` cache scope. Events
 * emitted during `refresh()` / `'auto-poll'` mode are SYNTHESIZED by

 * - `bootstrap` — initial sync completed; replica is current.
 * - `sync` — inbound webhook applied OR diff cycle completed

 * - `mode_resolved` — emitted on `start()` after the capability probe
 *   picks a mode. Useful for UI mode badges.
 * - `resyncing` — emitted before a `wholesale_feed.bulk_change` recovery
 *   re-bootstrap, webhook-version mismatch repair, or manual refresh.
 * - `error` — background poll/probe error. Non-fatal; sync stays in
 *   `'syncing'` and retries on the next tick.
