 * hatch for an agent whose MCP or REST binding answers on the same URL as its
 * A2A card.
 *
 * Still `undefined` for an A2A run, and deliberately so: whether A2A vectors
 * can be dispatched depends on whether the agent's CARD resolves to a JSONRPC
 * interface, which is a network question this synchronous resolver cannot
 * answer. The decision moved one level up, into `probeRequestSigningVector`,
 * which attempts the official-client precondition and only then frames. An
