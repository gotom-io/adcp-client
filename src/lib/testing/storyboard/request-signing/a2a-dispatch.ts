/**
 * A2A dispatch for request-signing vectors, through the OFFICIAL client.
 *
 * ## Why this exists, and why it is not a third hand-written binding
 *
 * RFC 9421 grading needs two things that pull against each other: the request
 * must be the one a real buyer's stack emits (or the grade says nothing about
 * interop), and the signature must cover the EXACT bytes that go on the wire
 * (or the verifier reconstructs a different signature base and every vector
 * fails for the wrong reason).
 *
 * Hand-building an A2A envelope satisfies the second and forfeits the first:
 * the method name, the proto-JSON enum spellings, the payload key and the
 * version header all become this file's guesses about a protocol it does not
 * own. That is the objection that closed adcp-client#2964, and it was a fair
 * one.
 *
 * So this module does neither. It drives `@a2a-js/sdk`'s own `ClientFactory`
 * and intercepts at the SDK's own `fetchImpl` seam — the request captured
 * there is the one the official client built and was about to send, byte for
 * byte. We sign those bytes and hand them to the existing hardened probe.
 *
 * What the SDK decides, and this file therefore never writes down:
 *
 * | decision              | who makes it                                  |
 * |-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
 * | endpoint              | the agent card's `supportedInterfaces[]`      |
 * | JSON-RPC method name  | the SDK, per the card's `protocolVersion`     |
 * | `a2a-version` header  | the SDK, from that same version               |
 * | proto-JSON encoding   | the SDK (`role` → `"ROLE_USER"`, not `1`)     |
 * | wire version          | the SDK client selected from the card         |
 *
 * That table is the whole argument. Observed, not assumed — against a card
 * declaring `1.0` the client emits `{"method":"SendMessage",...}` with
 * `a2a-version: 1.0`; against `0.3.0` it emits `{"method":"tasks/cancel",...}`
 * with `a2a-version: 0.3` for the same `cancelTask` call.
 *
 * ## The version header is inside the signature base, not added after it
 *
 * Capture happens BEFORE signing. `a2a-version` is therefore part of the
 * request the signer sees, which is the only ordering that works: the verifier
 * reconstructs the base from the headers it received, so a header appended
 * after signing sits outside the base the signer computed.
 *
 * ## Peer dependency
 *
 * `@a2a-js/sdk` is a peer dependency. The import is dynamic and lives inside
 * the A2A path, so grading an MCP agent never loads it and an adopter grading
 * MCP is never required to install it.

/**
 * The `legacyCompat` policy every dispatch in this file uses, named once so the
 * two call sites cannot drift apart.
 *
 * `enabled: true` reads like "prefer the old dialect", and it is worth being
 * precise that it does not mean that, because the naming invites exactly the
 * wrong fix. MEASURED against `@a2a-js/sdk`, one `cancelTask`, four
 * combinations:
 *
 * | card    | `enabled` | method emitted | `a2a-version` |
 * |---------|-----------|----------------|---------------|
 * | `1.0`   | `true`    | `CancelTask`   | `1.0`         |
 * | `1.0`   | `false`   | `CancelTask`   | `1.0`         |
 * | `0.3.0` | `true`    | `tasks/cancel` | `0.3`         |
 * | `0.3.0` | `false`   | `CancelTask`   | `1.0`         |
 *
 * So `true` is the CARD-FOLLOWING setting: a 1.0 card is never downgraded (the
 * first two rows are byte-identical), and a 0.3 card gets the `tasks/*` family
 * the AdCP spec names for it (security.mdx @ 3.1.1 :1045 cites "A2A 0.3.0
 * §7.x"). `false` is the setting that ignores the card — the last row is a
 * 1.0 frame sent to an agent that published 0.3, silently, which is the class
 * of defect this whole module exists to remove.
 *
 * A conformance runner grades the agent that the card describes, so the policy
 * that defers to the card is the only correct one here. This is deliberately
 * NOT operator-configurable at this layer: a flag that let a run select framing
 * the agent never advertised would produce a verdict about an agent that does
 * not exist. adcp-client#2973 tracks the separate questions of the library-wide
 * default and a CLI knob.
