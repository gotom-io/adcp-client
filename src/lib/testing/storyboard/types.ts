   *
   * Recognised names:
   *   - `controller` — the agent must advertise `comply_test_controller`.
   *     Detected from `options.agentTools`, `_profile.tools`, or discovery
   *     on reused clients. Direct callers that deliberately provide none of
   *     those surfaces bypass this check; their storyboard runs into the
   *     per-step `missing_test_controller` cascade instead.
   *   - `seeded_state` — the operator must pass `--asserts-seeded-state`
   *     (or set `assertsSeededState: true`) declaring that initial state
   *     has been provisioned out-of-band (HTTP admin, pre-test script,
   *     staging fixture). The runner does not verify the assertion;
   *     scenarios that need state still fail naturally if the seed is
   *     not actually present.
   *   - `real_wire` — always available. Tag scenarios that observe
   *     production behavior with this when you want them excluded from
   *     a future `--mock-only` mode; today the tag is a no-op gate.
   *   - `webhook_receiver` — the runner must be configured with a
   *     webhook receiver (`StoryboardRunOptions.webhook_receiver`).
   *     Autodetected from token presence: any step whose
   *     `sample_request` (or nested fields) references
   *     `{{runner.webhook_url:<step_id>}}` or `{{runner.webhook_base}}`
   *     declares this requirement implicitly. Authors do not need to
   *     write `requires: [webhook_receiver]` — the tokens are
   *     self-describing.
   *   - `request_signer` — the agent under test MUST advertise
   *     `request_signing.supported: true` in `get_adcp_capabilities`.
   *     Autodetected: any storyboard whose `id === 'signed_requests'`
   *     or contains a `request_signing_probe` step implicitly requires
   *     this. Skipped (storyboard not applicable) when the agent omits
   *     the capability claim — absence is a declaration that the agent
   *     does not offer verified signed requests, per
   *     `compliance/{version}/universal/signed-requests.yaml` gating
   *     ("Agents that do not advertise support are not tested against
   *     this storyboard — absence of advertisement is not a failure").
   *     Spec: adcp-client#1702.
   *   - `multi_agent` — the run must be configured with
   *     `StoryboardRunOptions.agents`, and the storyboard's authored
   *     route keys (`default_agent` plus any step-level `agent:` overrides)
   *     must resolve to at least two distinct entries in that agents map.
   *     This checks the routed topology the storyboard actually declares,
   *     not the raw number of available agents. Spec: adcp-client#2281.
   *
   * Default when the field is absent: `[real_wire]` (storyboard runs
   * everywhere — matches existing pre-tagging behavior). Tagging is
   * additive opt-in; loader rejects malformed values and an empty array
   * (`requires: []`) so authoring mistakes fail loud. Unknown string
   * requirements are forward-compatible: they load successfully, then skip
   * at runtime with `skip_reason: 'requirement_unmet'` and the authored name
   * on `RunnerSkipResult.requirement`.
   *
   * Spec: adcp-client#1626, adcp-client#2281. The schema may be proposed upstream to
   * `adcontextprotocol/adcp` once it has bedded in across SDK
   * storyboards.

   * result instead of running phases — avoiding misleading per-phase failures
   * when the storyboard tests behavior the agent explicitly opted out of.
   *
   * `path` is a dotted key path into the raw `get_adcp_capabilities` response
   * (e.g. `"adcp.idempotency.supported"`).
   *
   * Two matcher forms — mutually exclusive on a single gate:
   *
   * - `equals: V` — scalar equality. The path's resolved value must be
   *   declared and must equal `V` for the storyboard to run. When the path
   *   resolves to `undefined` (field absent), the storyboard is skipped as
   *   `capability_unsupported` unless the `get_adcp_capabilities` response
   *   schema declares a default for that exact path and the parent capability
   *   object is present.
   *
   * - `present: true|false` — presence-only matcher for spec capabilities whose
   *   contract is "presence of this object indicates support" (e.g.
   *   `media_buy.conversion_tracking`). `present: true` requires the value at
   *   `path` to exist (non-null, non-undefined); empty object `{}` counts as
   *   present. `present: false` requires the value to be absent — useful for
   *   scenarios that only apply to agents that explicitly do NOT advertise a
   *   capability. Unlike `equals`, absence is the load-bearing signal: when
   *   `present: true` and the field is missing, the storyboard is skipped
   *   (not_applicable) rather than run, because the seller's silence is the
   *   spec-defined opt-out. Schema defaults are NOT materialized for this
   *   matcher (unlike `equals`/`contains`): a default would make a defaulted
   *   field never read as absent, defeating the gate.
   *
   * - `contains: V` — array-membership matcher for capabilities whose
   *   declaration shape is an array of allowed values (e.g.
   *   `media_buy.conversion_tracking.supported_targets: ["cost_per",
   *   "per_ad_spend"]`). The value at `path` MUST be an array and MUST include
   *   `V` (strict equality, no coercion). Empty arrays fail; paths resolving
   *   to undefined or non-array values fail unless the `get_adcp_capabilities`
   *   response schema declares a default for that exact path and the parent
   *   capability object is present. Like `present:`, absence is otherwise the
   *   load-bearing signal — a seller that doesn't advertise the array hasn't
   *   opted into the variant this storyboard tests.
   *
   * When `raw_capabilities` is not available and the discovered profile does
   * not expose `get_adcp_capabilities`, `equals` gates are treated as
   * unsupported because there is no declaration proving the agent opted into
   * the behavior. Other matcher forms remain a no-op without raw
   * capabilities because their authored paths cannot be inspected.
