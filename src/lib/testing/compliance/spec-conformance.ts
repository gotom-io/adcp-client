/**
 * Cross-storyboard spec conformance gates.
 *
 * Some AdCP rules are universal (apply to any seller agent regardless of
 * which specialism they're testing) rather than per-storyboard. Encoding
 * them as per-storyboard `required_tools` predicates would mean tagging
 * every relevant scenario, and the rule would still drift for adopters
 * authoring third-party storyboards.
 *
 * This module emits synthetic `StoryboardResult`s for those rules — the
 * comply orchestrator pushes them into the storyboard-results array
 * before track grouping. Pipeline downstream (failure extraction, track
 * mapping, summary, skip-cause aggregator) treats them as any other
 * storyboard result.
 *
 * Currently wires one gate:
 *
 * - **Account discovery (adcp-client#1624 / adcp#4302).** Every seller
 *   agent (any specialism in `sales-*` / `audience-sync` / `governance-*`)
 *   MUST advertise at least one of `list_accounts` or `sync_accounts`.
 *   Spec normative as of AdCP 3.0.9; the requirement existed before the
 *   explicit MUST landed. The runner honors AdCP 3.1
 *   `required_any_of_tools` tags when present, but this fallback remains
 *   until upstream storyboards carry the tag consistently.

 *     exercises `sync_accounts` directly, confirming this scope.

/**
 * Run the account-discovery conformance gate. Returns `null` when the
 * gate doesn't apply (agent declared no account-bearing specialism,
 * couldn't enumerate specialisms, or already advertises a discovery
 * tool). Returns a synthetic failing `StoryboardResult` when the agent
 * is non-conformant.
 *
 * The returned result has:
 * - `overall_passed: false` so it counts toward `failed` in summaries
 * - one synthetic phase + step that surfaces the specific specialism(s)
 *   triggering the gate so operators can act
 * - `track` is left unset on the synthetic id; `extractFailures` falls
 *   back to `'core'` for any storyboard not in the applicable-storyboards
 *   lookup, which is correct — account discovery is a core protocol
 *   invariant, not a specialism-specific concern
 *
 * Note: when the agent doesn't expose `get_adcp_capabilities` (so
 * `profile.specialisms` is undefined), the gate is a no-op. The runner
 * separately surfaces an observation about the missing capability call;
 * we don't double-report.
 *
 * TODO(adcp-client#1642): delete this synthesis path when upstream
 * storyboards in `compliance/cache/` carry `required_any_of_tools`
 * consistently for every account-bearing scenario.
