 *   nothing to attest. Distinct from `pass` (real protection was
 *   validated) and `skip` (the track did not run). Companion to

/**
 * Provenance for an `AdvisoryObservation`. Every observation must carry
 * a `source` so triagers can trace the finding back to the rule that
 * fired and the storyboard/step coordinates that produced it.
 *
 * The discriminated union distinguishes:
 *
 * - `storyboard_step` — observation came from inspecting a specific
 *   step in a storyboard run. Has both `storyboard_id` and `step_id`,
 *   so a triager can grep the storyboard YAML directly.
 * - `storyboard` — observation aggregates across a storyboard's
 *   scenarios (e.g. "lifecycle scenario revealed missing pause/resume").
 *   Has `storyboard_id` but no specific step.
 * - `profile` — observation derived from the agent's discovered
 *   capability profile, not from any storyboard step (e.g. "agent
 *   exposes only 2 tools"). No storyboard coordinates apply.
 * - `probe` — observation came from a network probe outside the
 *   storyboard pipeline (e.g. auth-failure detection on a 401
 *   discovery response). No storyboard coordinates apply.
 *
 * **`storyboard_id` shape note.** For `storyboard_step` sources this field
 * is sourced from `TestResult.scenario`, which the storyboard runner
 * constructs as `${storyboard_id}/${phase_id}` (see
 * `storyboard-tracks.ts`). For storyboard-wide sources it is the bare
 * storyboard ID because no single phase owns the finding.
 *
 * **`code` casing note.** `code` is intentionally kebab-case
 * (e.g. `slow-response`, `missing-valid-actions`) to match storyboard
 * step-id conventions in the compliance YAML cache, even though the
 * rest of the public SDK surface (`storyboard_id`, `step_id`,
 * `agent_url`, …) is snake_case. Adopters greppable-searching
 * compliance reports should expect the kebab form.
