 * v3-only fields, converts `status` enum → `approved` boolean, and groups
 * v3 assignment edges into v2.5's creative-keyed package mapping. `assets`
 * passes through with the v3 `asset_type` discriminator stripped because
 * v2.5 does not declare that embedded field and structurally matches assets.
