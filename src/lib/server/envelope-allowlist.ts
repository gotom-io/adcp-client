/**
 * Envelope-allowlist governance for AdCP error responses.
 *
 * Two orthogonal concerns both govern what round-trips on an AdCP error
 * envelope. They live side-by-side here so that a change to one forces
 * the reviewer to weigh the other (security review M4 on #788 — the
 * pair is conceptually related and can drift in separate files).
 *
 * - `ERROR_ENVELOPE_FIELD_ALLOWLIST` governs keys that may appear as
 *   SIBLINGS of `adcp_error` on the wire response. Enforced by
 *   `wrapEnvelope` in `./wrap-envelope.ts`.
 * - `ADCP_ERROR_FIELD_ALLOWLIST` governs keys that may appear INSIDE
 *   the `adcp_error` block, keyed by error code. Consumed by
 *   `adcpError()` (which filters its output to the allowlisted set)
 *   AND by the dispatcher in `create-adcp-server.ts` (re-applied to
 *   every handler-returned envelope via `sanitizeAdcpErrorEnvelope`
 *   — defence-in-depth for handlers that hand-roll an error envelope
 *   instead of going through the builder). The same set powers the
 *   `idempotency.conflict_no_payload_leak` invariant in
 *   `../testing/storyboard/default-invariants.ts`. The legacy
 *   `CONFLICT_ADCP_ERROR_ALLOWLIST` export is a convenience alias for
 *   the `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT` entry.
 *
 * Both sets apply to the same wire response but at different nesting
 * levels. A seller that needs to extend one should audit whether the
 * other also needs updating.
 *
 * Hand-rolling an error envelope? Prefer `adcpError(code, options)` —
 * it wraps both transport layers and applies this allowlist for you.
 * The dispatcher sanitizer is a belt-and-suspenders, not a primary API.

/**
 * Fail-closed default allowlist for unknown error codes.
 *
 * An error code without an explicit entry in
 * `ERROR_ENVELOPE_FIELD_ALLOWLIST` gets this set — only `context`
 * round-trips (matching the invariant that every allowlist permits
 * correlation tracing). Sellers that want `replayed` or `operation_id`
 * on a bespoke error code must register it explicitly.
 *
 * This is the fail-closed posture — sellers MUST opt in to any field
 * they want on an error envelope, rather than inheriting success-path
 * semantics by default. Security review M3 on #788.

 * A code listed here restricts which envelope fields `wrapEnvelope`
 * will attach on top of the error's inner payload. Codes NOT listed
 * here receive `DEFAULT_ERROR_ENVELOPE_FIELDS` (fail-closed —

 *
 * `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT` deliberately excludes `replayed`: the
 * conflict path in `create-adcp-server.ts` builds its error via
 * `finalize()`, which only echoes `context` and never calls
 * `stampReplayed`. The framework's own behavior is preserved.
 *

/**
 * Per-error-code allowlist for keys permitted INSIDE the `adcp_error`
 * block. The `adcpError()` builder consults this table and drops any
 * field the caller passes that isn't allowlisted for the given code —
 * the allowlist IS the contract for what a framework-emitted error may
 * carry. Storyboard invariants enforce the same contract on the wire.
 *
 * A code without an explicit entry permits everything `adcpError()`
 * would otherwise emit — the default case is pass-through. Sellers who
 * want a bespoke code to be strict should register it here (or wrap
 * `adcpError()` with their own sanitizer).
 *
 * **Scope warning for future contributors:** only register a code here
 * if it belongs to the AdCP standard error vocabulary (`enums/error-code.json`).
 * Per `core/error.json`, clients "MUST handle unknown codes gracefully
 * by falling back to the recovery classification" — so dropping
 * `recovery` on a vendor / non-standard code makes the response
 * genuinely lossy for any buyer agent that doesn't have the code in
 * its local vocabulary.
 *
 * `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT` is narrow on purpose: a conflict response MUST
 * NOT echo the prior request payload or cached response (stolen-key
 * read oracle defence). Standard recovery metadata is allowed because it
 * is normalized to the fixed classifier, not trusted as caller-provided
 * prior request or cached response data.
 * `retry_after` is excluded: no framework path currently emits it on conflict, and a seller
 * that computed `retry_after = cached_entry_age` would leak the prior
 * payload's creation time (a distinguisher between "key never seen" vs
 * "key seen N seconds ago"). Retry hints belong on transient codes
 * (`SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`, `RATE_LIMITED`), not on a terminal conflict.
 * `adcpError()` and the dispatcher sanitizer both enforce this.
