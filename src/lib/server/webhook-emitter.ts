/**
 * Publisher-side webhook emitter — the symmetric counterpart to PR #629's
 * receiver-side dedup. A seller / governance agent / rights agent building
 * with `@adcp/sdk` gets a one-call API that handles:
 *
 *   - RFC 9421 webhook signing on every attempt (adcp#2423).
 *   - A stable `idempotency_key` per logical event, reused across retries
 *     (adcp#2417) — regenerating on retry is the #1 at-least-once-delivery
 *     bug the runner-side conformance suite catches.
 *   - Compact-separator JSON serialization once, signed once, posted once
 *     (adcp#2478) — prevents the serialization-mismatch trap where a
 *     signer's byte view differs from what the HTTP client writes.
 *   - Retry/backoff on 5xx and 429. Terminal on 4xx and on 401 responses
 *     carrying `WWW-Authenticate: Signature error="webhook_signature_*"`
 *     (spec says retrying a signature failure just fails identically).
 *   - HMAC-SHA256 fallback for legacy buyers that registered
 *     `push_notification_config.authentication.credentials` — still pinned
 *     to compact separators per adcp#2478.
 *
 * Handler authors using `createAdcpServer` call `ctx.emitWebhook(...)` with
 * a `url`, complete payload, and SDK-local `delivery_id` — everything else
 * is wired in. The payload's AdCP `operation_id` remains a separate task
 * correlation identifier and MUST NOT be substituted for `delivery_id` when
 * one operation can emit more than one status observation.
