/**
 * Opaque AdCP server handle.
 *
 * `createAdcpServer()` returns a value typed as `AdcpServer` rather than the
 * underlying `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` `McpServer`. Two reasons:
 *
 *   1. **Dual-package hazard.** Re-exporting the SDK's `McpServer` type from
 *      our public API forces downstream consumers through a specific SDK
 *      resolution path (ESM or CJS). When a TypeScript ESM consumer
 *      imports `@adcp/sdk` (CJS) and separately imports the SDK (ESM),
 *      the two `McpServer` types are structurally identical but distinct
 *      — the SDK's private `_serverInfo` field breaks assignment
 *      compatibility between them. Owning the type on our side
 *      eliminates the hazard: `AdcpServer` resolves the same way for
 *      every consumer because it comes from a single package.
 *
 *   2. **Test ergonomics.** Downstream test harnesses have been reaching
 *      into `(server as any)._requestHandlers` and
 *      `server.server._requestHandlers` to dispatch tool calls in-process.
 *      `dispatchTestRequest()` moves that private-field access into a
 *      single encapsulated helper so consumers don't have to repeat it.
 *
 * To register additional tools or resources, configure them through
 * `createAdcpServer()`'s domain-grouped handler config. The opaque
 * surface intentionally doesn't expose `registerTool()` — keeping it off the
 * public API lets the framework own tool registration conventions
 * (idempotency, governance, validation, response shape).
