/**
 * ProposalManager — primitives for the two-platform composition.
 *
 * The existing `DecisioningPlatform` conflates two concerns: assembling
 * proposals from briefs (`get_products`, refine) vs. executing media buys
 * against an upstream (`create_media_buy`, `update_media_buy`,
 * `get_media_buy_delivery`). The two-platform composition splits them: a
 * separate {@link ProposalManager} handles the proposal side; the
 * `DecisioningPlatform` keeps the execution side. Either platform can be
 * mock-backed independently.
 *
 * Ports the Python primitives shipped in `adcp-client-python` PRs #504
 * (v1) and #550 (v1.5):
 *
 *   - {@link ProposalManager} — interface with `getProducts` (required)
 *     plus optional `refineProducts` and `finalizeProposal`.
 *   - {@link ProposalCapabilities} — sales-axis-scoped capability flags.
 *   - {@link Recipe} — typed `recipe_kind`-discriminated base; adopters
 *     subclass with their internal-config schema. Rides on
 *     `Product.implementation_config` (opaque to the buyer).
 *   - {@link CapabilityOverlap} — typed declaration of which wire
 *     capabilities the buyer can configure on a product. The framework
 *     validates buyer requests against the overlap pre-adapter.
 *   - {@link FinalizeProposalRequest} / {@link FinalizeProposalSuccess} —
 *     framework-internal shapes for the finalize lifecycle (wired in the
 *     v1.5 dispatch helpers).
