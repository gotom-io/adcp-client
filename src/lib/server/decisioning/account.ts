   * on TypeScript narrowing alone — the strip is enforced at the dispatcher.
   *

   * threading as `upsert`. Adopters MUST gate per-entry persistence by the
   * caller's tenant: each entry's `account.operator` (or `account_id`) must
   * map to the same tenant the auth principal authorizes; otherwise return a
   * `'failed'` row carrying `errors: [{code: 'PERMISSION_DENIED', ...}]` for

   * Mid-request token refresh hook. Optional. Called by the framework when
   * a platform method throws a refreshable token-auth code (`AUTH_REQUIRED`
   * for legacy compatibility or `AUTH_MISSING` for an AdCP 3.1-native
   * missing request credential) AND `refreshToken` is defined — the
   * framework refreshes via this hook, mutates or creates `account.authInfo`
   * with the returned token, and retries the failing platform method exactly
   * once.
   *
   * The reason string lets adopters distinguish trigger conditions:
   *   - `'auth_required'` — platform method threw refreshable auth in flight.
   *
   * Treat as an open string union: future values may be added. Adopters
   * SHOULD switch exhaustively (`default: throw`) so behavior drift on
   * minor SDK bumps fails loud rather than silently no-oping.
   *
   * **In-flight only.** The refreshed token is scoped to the current
   * request — the framework does NOT echo it back to the buyer. Use this
   * for adapters that front an upstream platform API (Snap, Meta,
   * retail-media OAuth flows) where the SDK caches an upstream token
   * server-side and the buyer's auth-to-this-agent is separate.
   *
   * **Account-object identity contract.** The framework mutates a
   * request-local Account clone before retrying, creating an OAuth-shaped
   * auth principal if the resolver omitted one. The resolver-returned object
   * is not written back. Adopters should still avoid caching secret-bearing
   * `Account.authInfo` objects across unrelated callers, but SDK refresh
   * retry does not mutate a cached resolver object in place.
   *
   * **Concurrency.** `refreshToken` MUST be safe under concurrent
   * invocation on the same account — two parallel in-flight calls hitting
   * refreshable auth at once will both call this hook. Adopters whose
   * upstream provider rate-limits refresh should coalesce internally
   * (e.g., a per-account in-flight refresh promise). The framework does
   * not coalesce.
   *
   * **Failure surfaces correctable AUTH_REQUIRED.** If `refreshToken`
   * itself throws, the framework projects to `AUTH_REQUIRED` with
   * `recovery: 'correctable'` and a fixed message (the inner exception
   * text is NOT echoed on the wire — refresh failures routinely include
   * upstream details that should not cross the trust boundary). Log inner
   * details server-side. Don't use SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE — refresh failure
   * means the upstream authorization is gone, not that the service is
   * transiently down.
   *
   * **Expiry timestamp** (`expiresAt`, ms since epoch) is optional. When
   * returned, the framework writes it to `account.authInfo.expiresAt` so
   * adopters reading the resolved Account can branch on it (proactive
   * refresh is not yet wired; reactive-only in v6.x).
