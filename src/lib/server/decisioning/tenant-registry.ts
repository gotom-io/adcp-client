/**
 * TenantRegistry — multi-tenant deployment helper for the v6.0 decisioning
 * runtime.
 *
 * Holds a map of `agentUrl → TenantConfig` and tracks per-tenant health.
 * Composes with the existing `serve()` host-routing surface: the registry
 * returns an `AdcpServer` factory that dispatches based on `ctx.host`.
 *
 * **Three health states**, never startup-fatal:
 *
 *   - `healthy` — JWKS validated, accepting traffic normally.
 *   - `unverified` — validation hasn't completed (server starting, or
 *     JWKS unreachable transiently). Tenant accepts traffic with a
 *     warning header; framework periodically re-validates.
 *   - `disabled` — validation failed deterministically (signing key not
 *     in published JWKS, brand.json malformed). Tenant returns
 *     `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` until an admin recheck succeeds.
 *
 * One bad tenant doesn't take down others — health is per-tenant, the
 * other tenants keep serving.
 *
 * Status: Preview / 6.0.

   * outbound seller-→buyer signing surface: webhook deliveries. The
   * synchronous tools/call reply is **not** signed at the body level
   * — TLS provides session-scoped integrity for the immediate response,
   * and signed webhooks carry durable at-rest integrity for async
   * artifacts. This is the deliberate two-surface design, not a
   * coverage gap; see `docs/building/understanding/security-model.mdx`
   * § "What gets signed — and what doesn't" (adcp#3737, resolved by
   * adcp#3742). Adopters who need attestable artifacts for
   * synchronous flows structure the tool to emit a signed webhook
   * (the "request-the-webhook" pattern in the same doc).
   *
   * When set, the registry does two things:
   *
   *   1. **JWKS validation.** Confirms `publicJwk` appears in the
   *      tenant's published JWKS at `{agentUrl}/.well-known/brand.json`
   *      (or `jwksUrl` if overridden) before transitioning the tenant
   *      to `healthy`.
   *   2. **Webhook auto-wire.** Plumbs the privateJwk into
   *      `serverOptions.webhooks.signerKey` automatically, so outbound
   *      webhook deliveries are signed without the adopter wiring the
   *      key twice. Strict on `adcp_use: "webhook-signing"` per AdCP
   *      key-purpose discriminator (adcp#2423). Adopters wiring a
   *      KMS-backed signer or a distinct webhook key per tenant set
   *      `serverOptions.webhooks.signerKey` / `signerProvider`
   *      explicitly — the explicit config wins and auto-wiring is
   *      skipped.
   *
   * When omitted, both behaviors short-circuit: JWKS validation is
   * skipped, the tenant transitions directly from `pending` to
   * `healthy` on register() with `reason: 'unsigned (no signingKey)'`,
   * and outbound webhooks are emitted unsigned (or, in 4.0, would be
   * a registration error). AdCP 3.x treats signing as optional, so
   * adopters spiking the SDK before standing up KMS or publishing
   * brand.json can ship without signing material. Buyers MUST NOT
   * break when an agent doesn't sign in 3.x — that's covered by the
   * "tolerate Signature headers" baseline regardless of whether the
   * agent itself signs.
   *
   * For local dev with signing enabled, pair `createSelfSignedTenantKey()`
   * (generates an Ed25519 keypair already tagged
   * `adcp_use: "webhook-signing"`) with `createNoopJwksValidator()`
   * (skips the brand.json roundtrip in dev/test). Production adopters
   * keep the default validator and publish the public half via
   * brand.json. See `docs/guides/SIGNING-GUIDE.md` § "Self-signed dev
   * path" for the worked recipe.
