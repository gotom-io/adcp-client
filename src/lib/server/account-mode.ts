 * Account-mode primitives for sandbox-authority enforcement of

 * The hard rule: under no circumstances should the comply test
 * controller (or any test-only surface) operate on a `live`-mode
 * account. The flag must live on the resolved account, not on a
 * process-level env var — env vars are operator-error-prone proxies
 * for what is fundamentally an authority decision per principal.
 *
 * This module ships the type + helpers; auto-wiring into
 * `createAdcpServerFromPlatform`'s `complyTest` path lands in a
 * follow-up alongside mock-mode routing (#1435 Phase 2).

 *     their test infrastructure. Test-only surfaces are allowed.
 *   - `mock`: SDK-routed-to-mock-server. Adopter's code is bypassed; the
 *     SDK forwards to the mock upstream backend. Test-only surfaces are

 *
 * Adopters that have not yet migrated to the `mode` field continue to

 * the prototype chain, so an attacker who reaches a `__proto__`-via-merge
 * sink upstream (reachable in MCP envelope handling and similar deep-merge
 * sites) could stamp `Object.prototype.mode = 'sandbox'` and silently
 * downgrade every account's gate to a no-op. The own-property check makes
 * the gate immune to that class of attack regardless of upstream hardening.

/**
 * Throws an `AdcpError('PERMISSION_DENIED')` if the account is not in
 * a non-production mode. Use to gate dispatch of test-only surfaces.
 *
 * Fail-closed semantics:
 *   - `account === undefined` (no resolved account): throws.
 *   - `account.mode === 'live'` or unspecified + no `sandbox: true`:
 *     throws.
 *   - `account.mode === 'sandbox' | 'mock'` (or legacy `sandbox: true`):
 *     no-op, dispatch proceeds.
 *
 * The `details` payload carries `{ scope: 'sandbox-gate', tool? }` so
 * dashboards can distinguish gate-rejections from other permission
 * denials.
 *
 * **Resolver discipline.** The strength of this gate depends entirely on
 * how the adopter's `AccountStore.resolve` constructs its return value.
 * Resolvers MUST NOT spread untrusted input (request body, headers,
 * `ctx_metadata`, query params) into the resolved account — doing so lets
 * a buyer self-promote to `mode: 'sandbox'` and unlock test-only surfaces
 * on a live principal. Source `mode` (and `sandbox`) from a trusted store
 * keyed by the authenticated principal; never from request data.
 *
 * **opts.message must be a static string literal.** The message is echoed
 * on the wire inside the error envelope. Interpolating user-controlled
 * values into it creates a reflection sink (PII leakage, log injection,
 * downstream HTML rendering). Pick from a fixed set of messages keyed by
 * `tool` if you need variants.
 *
 * @param account The resolved account (typically `ctx.account` inside
 *   a tool dispatch). Pass `undefined` if no account resolved — the
 *   helper fails closed.
 * @param opts.tool Optional tool name to surface in the error details
 *   (e.g., `'comply_test_controller'`).
 * @param opts.message Optional override for the user-facing message.
 *   MUST be a static string literal — see "opts.message" note above.
 *
 * @example
 *   import { assertSandboxAccount } from '@adcp/sdk/server';
 *
 *   sandboxGate: input => {
 *     const account = await resolveAccount(input);
 *     assertSandboxAccount(account, { tool: 'comply_test_controller' });
