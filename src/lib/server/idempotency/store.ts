/**
 * Idempotency store for AdCP server handlers.
 *
 * AdCP v3 requires `idempotency_key` on every mutating request. This store:
 *
 * 1. Hashes the canonical request payload (RFC 8785 JCS) to detect same-key
 *    reuse with a different payload → `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`.
 * 2. Caches successful response payloads per `(principal, key)` for the
 *    declared replay window, so retries of the same key return the same
 *    response — without re-executing side effects.
 * 3. Rejects keys past the TTL (with ±60s clock-skew tolerance) as
 *    `IDEMPOTENCY_EXPIRED`, turning the silent-double-book footgun into
 *    a loud failure.
 * 4. Declares the window on `get_adcp_capabilities` so buyers can reason
 *    about retry safety.
 *
 * Scope is `(principal, key)` — keys don't need to be globally unique,
 * just unique per principal. Per-principal scoping prevents cross-tenant
 * replay oracles where one tenant could probe another's cached responses.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { createAdcpServer, createIdempotencyStore, memoryBackend } from '@adcp/sdk/server/legacy/v5';
 *
 * const idempotency = createIdempotencyStore({
 *   backend: memoryBackend(),
 *   ttlSeconds: 86400,
 * });
 *
 * createAdcpServer({
 *   idempotency,
 *   resolveSessionKey: (ctx) => ctx.account?.id,  // doubles as idempotency principal
 *   mediaBuy: { createMediaBuy: async (params, ctx) => {...} },
 * });
 * ```

 * - `context` — varies on retry by design (correlation IDs, etc.) BUT
 *   only when it's the standard object echo-back shape. Some tools
 *   (`si_initiate_session`, `si_get_offering`) use `context` as a
 *   load-bearing string; strings are kept in the hash so that a retry
 *   with a different handoff description is correctly flagged as
 *   IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT.
 * - `governance_context` — may be a refreshed signed token on retry
 * - `push_notification_config.authentication.credentials` — may be a rotated
 *   bearer/HMAC credential.
 * - `reporting_webhook.authentication.credentials` — same write-only
 *   credential semantics for reporting delivery.
 *
 * For both webhook registrations, URL, scheme, token, reporting frequency,
 * requested metrics, and every other routing/semantic field stay in the hash;

/**
 * Configuration for `createIdempotencyStore`.

 * **Cached responses at rest — handler responsibility.** The store

 * `JSON.stringify`-s it into the configured backend for the declared
 * `ttlSeconds` (default 24h, max 7d). The hash-exclusion list strips
 * `idempotency_key`, `governance_context`, and
 * `authentication.credentials` from both `push_notification_config`
 * and `reporting_webhook` from the **hash** so a rotated credential on
 * retry doesn't false-conflict. URL, scheme, token, frequency, metrics,
 * and all other routing/semantic fields remain hashed,
 * but the **stored response** is the handler's verbatim output.
 *
 * If a handler returns a response that includes:
 *
 * - a refreshed bearer / OAuth access token,
 * - a signed governance / auth payload,
 * - `push_notification_config.authentication.credentials` (a buyer-
 *   supplied write-only secret — the contract is that sellers MUST
 *   NOT echo it back; receipt correlation uses
 *   `push_notification_config.token` instead),
 * - `reporting_webhook.authentication.credentials` (the equivalent
 *   write-only reporting-delivery secret),
 * - any other secret material,
 *
 * those secrets sit at rest in the backend for `ttlSeconds`. On Redis
 * without TLS, they're also plaintext over the wire. The framework
 * does not scrub responses before caching — the AdCP spec doesn't
 * require it of either party, and a built-in scrubber would change
 * the wire shape of legitimate adopter responses without warning.
 *
 * Practical guidance:
 *
 * - **Don't return credentials in handler responses.** No AdCP tool's
 *   response schema asks for them; if your adapter is echoing them
 *   back, refactor. `push_notification_config.credentials` in
 *   particular is write-only — `token` is the field a seller uses to
 *   confirm receipt.
 * - If a handler nonetheless must produce a secret-bearing response
 *   (e.g., an internal-only echo for adapter debugging), wrap your
 *   handler to scrub before returning, OR use a custom
 *   `IdempotencyBackend` that transforms entries on the write path.
 *
 * See also `docs/guides/CTX-METADATA-SAFETY.md` for related guidance
 * on what NOT to put in `ctx_metadata` (which has its own caching
 * surface with the same at-rest concern).
