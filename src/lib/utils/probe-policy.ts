/**
 * Probe policy for buyer-side discovery (adcp-client#1618).
 *
 * Whether the SDK is willing to issue an outbound probe to a given URL
 * during agent discovery (`detectProtocol` well-known card fetches,
 * `createTestClient` agent URL acceptance). Sits one layer above the
 * `src/lib/net/address-guards.ts` IP classifiers and the `ssrfSafeFetch`
 * primitive — those operate on already-resolved addresses; this layer
 * applies a higher-level allow/deny decision keyed on the URL hostname
 * before anything reaches DNS.
 *
 * ## Default policy
 *
 * | Range                                       | Default | Why                                                     |
 * | ------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
 * | Loopback (`127.0.0.0/8`, `::1`, `localhost`)| allow   | Local dev loops, mock-server tests, `npm run dev`       |
 * | RFC 1918 / link-local / IPv6 ULA            | deny    | Internal subnets behind a server-side comply runner     |
 * | Cloud metadata (`169.254.169.254`, `fe80::/10`) | deny | IMDS exfiltration is never a legitimate buyer use case  |
 * | Public IPv4/IPv6                            | allow   | The whole point                                         |
 *
 * ## Single opt-out
 *
 * `ADCP_ALLOW_INTERNAL_PROBES=1` (read once at module load) widens the
 * default to allow RFC-1918/link-local/ULA. IMDS stays blocked even with
 * this flag — cloud metadata reach is never legitimate.
 *
 * NOT controlled by `NODE_ENV`: a multi-tenant staging image with
 * `NODE_ENV=test` MUST NOT inherit looser SSRF posture than production.
 *
 * ## Known gap (TOCTOU) — adcp-client#1627
 *
 * `classifyProbeUrl` does NOT do DNS resolution — it inspects the
 * URL's hostname literal. A hostname like `evil.example.com` that
 * resolves to `169.254.169.254` will pass this gate; the per-IP block
 * inside `ssrfSafeFetch` (which DOES resolve and pin) catches it.
 * Use both: this gate refuses obvious literal attacks; `ssrfSafeFetch`
 * refuses DNS-based attacks. Routing `detectProtocol` through
 * `ssrfSafeFetch` for full TOCTOU defense is tracked under #1627.
