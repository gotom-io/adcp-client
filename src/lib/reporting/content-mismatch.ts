/**
 * Buyer-side `content_mismatch` detection (AdCP 3.2.0-rc.3).
 *
 * `content_mismatch` says: the buyer consumed the exact revision the seller
 * requires, and its content contradicts a fact the accepted configuration
 * generation **already fixed**. Every code is decidable from the obligation,
 * the pinned report definition, and the revision itself — with no reference to
 * either party's own measurement.
 *
 * Two boundaries govern everything below, and both are easy to breach in the
 * permissive direction:
 *
 * 1. **Never a measurement dispute.** A disagreement about *how many
 *    impressions the seller counted* belongs to `measurement_terms` and
 *    `makegood_policy`. Nothing here compares a delivered number against a
 *    buyer-side expectation, and nothing here should be extended to.
 * 2. **Never fire on evidence you do not have.** A false `content_mismatch` is
 *    expensive: per `consumer_status_projection` it forces the caller's view to
 *    `action_required`, and the seller MUST NOT return the period to healthy
 *    while that statement is the current leaf. So four of the six codes are
 *    **row-level** predicates that the obligation and revision *metadata*
 *    cannot decide, and they stay silent unless the caller supplies what it
 *    actually read. Silence is the safe default; a confident wrong answer is
 *    not.
 *
 * Which codes need row evidence, and why the metadata alone cannot substitute:
 *
 * | code | spec predicate | decidable from metadata? |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `scope_media_buy_missing` | a frozen buy is absent from the revision **and not represented by an explicit zero row** | **No.** `reporting-revision.json` defines `media_buy_ids` as the denominator *"inherited from the obligation, including buys with zero rows"*, so comparing the two sets is a tautology against a conformant seller. |
 * | `coverage_short` | revision covers fewer packages than the obligation's frozen `coverage.covered_package_ids` | **Yes.** |
 * | `metric_missing` | a metric named in the pinned definition's `metrics[].name` is absent | **No.** `control_totals` are profile-defined aggregates scoped to `coverage.covered_package_ids`, a different and usually smaller set than the definition's metrics. |
 * | `schema_nonconformant` | rows do not validate against the pinned `schema_uri`/`schema_sha256` | **No.** Requires actually validating rows. |
 * | `currency_mismatch` | a value's unit disagrees with the unit the pinned definition fixed | **Yes.** |
 * | `period_mismatch` | a row time dimension carries values outside the half-open period | **No.** The revision envelope is pinned stable by `slice_identity`; the violation lives in row values. |

/**

 *
 * **What `reconcileReporting` can reach, and what it cannot.** The reconciler
 * consumes the revision's rows to recompute its binding digest, so it calls
 * this with real row evidence — but it can only derive `observedMetricNames`,
 * and only when the buyer pinned `committedMetrics`. That makes
 * `coverage_short`, `currency_mismatch` and `metric_missing` reachable through
 * the reconcile loop. The remaining three are a **documented limitation**:
 *
 * - `scope_media_buy_missing` needs to know which media buy a row belongs to.
 * - `period_mismatch` needs the time dimension the pinned grain declares.
 * - `schema_nonconformant` needs the rows validated against the pinned schema.
 *
 * All three depend on the reporting profile's own row shape, which is
 * profile-defined and not readable from a generic row object. The SDK does not
 * guess at them, because the cost of being wrong is asymmetric: a false
 * `content_mismatch` pins the caller's view at `action_required` and the seller
 * MUST NOT return the period to healthy while the statement is the current
 * leaf. An adopter whose own reader *does* understand its profile can call this
 * function directly with a fuller `ReportingRowEvidenceV1` and act on the
 * result.
 *
 * **Precedence.** The spec pins exactly one ordering rule: a metric that is
 * simply absent uses `metric_missing` even when the pinned schema declares it
 * required, so `metric_missing` is evaluated before `schema_nonconformant`.
 * The remaining order is this SDK's, chosen so the most structural fact wins —
 * a revision missing a whole media buy reports that, not whichever metric
 * happened to go missing with it — and is stable so the code does not flap
 * between reads of the same bytes.
