   * - `consumption_unavailable` — no exact-revision reader is wired, so the

   *   could consume the revision. Self-inflicted, so it is silence rather than
   *   an `unreadable` claim against a seller that did nothing wrong.
   * - `deadline_unknown` — no posting deadline could be derived, so this period
   *   will never post. Two causes, both named in `reason`: a pin the buyer has
   *   to supply is missing, or the seller's own `obligation.expected_at` is
   *   unreadable and its `schedule.delivery_sla` did not resolve one either.
   *   Without this value a permanent misconfiguration renders exactly like a
   *   period that is simply not due yet.
   * - `chain_indeterminate` — the seller's revision chain forked, or the buyer
   *   could not walk it. That is the buyer failing to read, not the seller
