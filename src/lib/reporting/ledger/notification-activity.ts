 * authority fails closed before the checkpoint — so it can be dropped when it
 * goes stale, which closes the window where a destination is replaced between
 * candidate enumeration and the first POST. A recipient that has been
 * checkpointed is pinned forever, so a crash after an ambiguous send can never
 * be turned into a second delivery under a new destination generation. One
 * recipient's attempt never pins a sibling.
