Add supply-path verification with a typed canonical registry wrapper and a live authoritative mode that checks owner/host adagents.json declarations and ads.txt/app-ads.txt evidence. Return per-leg diagnostics and auditable fetch provenance, with DNS-pinned SSRF protection, bounded fetching and fail-closed handling of malformed or unresolved authorization constraints.

Add opt-in external collection path annotations for product discovery, public selector/distribution types, and an explicit distinction between authorization bulk grants and product selectors that require concrete collection IDs.

Support explicit publisher attribution on shared collection declarations, bounded process-local authority admission, durable tenant-scoped stores, and independent authority migration confirmation. Establish first-use pins only after successful manifest validation, with a read-only precheck and atomic successful-observation commit.

Persist parsed revocations before later fetch or authority-store failures, preserving their seven-day hold through failed affirmative verification.
