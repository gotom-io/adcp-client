# Contributing to @adcp/sdk

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the AdCP client library as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Intellectual Property Rights

Before contributing to the AdCP project, ensure that you have read and agree with our [Intellectual Property Rights Policy](https://github.com/adcontextprotocol/adcp/blob/main/IPR_POLICY.md).

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/adcp-client.git
cd adcp-client
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the test suite
npm test

# Build the library
npm run build
```

#### npm-only workspaces

This repo is an npm workspace with two packages — the SDK at the root (`@adcp/sdk`) and the legacy-name compat shim under `packages/client-shim/` (`@adcp/client`). The root `package.json` lists `workspaces: [".", "packages/*"]`, with the leading `"."` so the shim can resolve the root package as a workspace member rather than reaching for the registry.

That `"."` entry is supported by **npm only** — pnpm rejects it, and Yarn behavior varies by version. The repo pins `packageManager: "npm@10.9.7"` so Corepack-aware setups pick the right tool automatically. If you contribute via pnpm or Yarn, the install will fail until you switch to npm. Once a future restructure moves the SDK into `packages/sdk/`, the `"."` entry can drop and pnpm/Yarn become viable.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **TypeScript**: All new code should be written in TypeScript
- **ESLint**: Follow the existing linting rules
- **Prettier**: Format code with Prettier (automatically on commit)
- **JSDoc**: Add comprehensive documentation for all public APIs

### Library vs Server Code

**Library Code (`src/lib/`)**:

- Must be framework-agnostic
- Minimal dependencies (only protocol SDKs)
- Pure functions where possible
- Comprehensive error handling
- Full TypeScript types

### Testing

- **Unit tests** for all library functions
- **Integration tests** for protocol implementations
- **End-to-end tests** for the complete workflow
- Tests should be in `test/` directory
- Use Node.js built-in test runner

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test test/client.test.js

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

#### Debugging a hung test

Every test has a 60-second per-test timeout (`--test-timeout=60000`). If a test legitimately runs longer you'll see a timeout error with a stack trace — that's the identifying information you need.

If the runner itself appears stuck (spinning at high CPU, no output), send `SIGQUIT` to dump the JS stack before killing the process:

```bash
# In another terminal, find the PID (scoped to your user)
pgrep -u "$USER" -af 'node --test'

# Dump the V8 stack to stderr
kill -QUIT <pid>
```

The stack trace points at the spinning function. If the same stack reappears across runs, capture it in the bug report — a 30-second autopsy beats a 30-hour one.

## Adding a new specialism

When introducing support for a new AdCP specialism (`governance-spend-authority`, `brand-rights`, an additional `sales-*` variant, etc.), follow this order. **Worked example first; skill prose last.** Reverses the obvious order on purpose: skill prose written before a worked example tends to drift as the spec evolves; pattern-from-example doesn't, because the test gates fail.

### 1. Mock-server with deterministic-seeded fixtures

Add `src/lib/mock-server/<specialism>/`:
- `server.ts` — boots an HTTP server that mirrors a real upstream's wire shape (GAM-shape for guaranteed, walled-garden CAPI-shape for social, etc.).
- `seed-data.ts` — fixture state. Seeds must be **deterministic** so storyboard replay is stable. Brand names in seed data MUST be fictional (`acme-outdoor.example`, NOT `tiktok_test_*`).
- Per-route traffic counters at `/_debug/traffic` for the façade gate.

Wire into `src/lib/mock-server/index.ts` `bootMockServer({specialism})`.

### 2. Worked reference adapter

`examples/hello_<role>_adapter_<specialism>.ts` — where `<role>` is the AdCP protocol layer (`seller` for `media-buy`, `creative` for `creative`, `signals` for `signals`, `governance` for `governance`, `brand` for `brand`) and `<specialism>` is the part of the specialism name AFTER the role-implied prefix (so `creative-template` → `_template`, `sales-guaranteed` → `_guaranteed`).

The adapter:
- Wraps the mock-server upstream via `createUpstreamHttpClient`.
- Implements the typed platform interface(s) for the specialism (per `RequiredPlatformsFor<S>`).
- Marks every upstream call with a `// SWAP:` comment — the seam adopters replace.
- Includes a `FORK CHECKLIST` header block before the imports listing the unmarked-but-load-bearing constants (`KNOWN_PUBLISHERS`, hardcoded thresholds, default workspace IDs, port numbers) adopters must change.
- Demonstrates the planning surface where applicable — `Product.forecast`, `audience_match`, etc. Worked examples that only exercise CRUD are weaker fork-targets.

### 3. Three-gate CI test

`test/examples/hello-<role>-adapter-<specialism>.test.js` using the `runHelloAdapterGates()` helper from `test/examples/_helpers/`.

Three gates per [`docs/guides/EXAMPLE-TEST-CONTRACT.md`](docs/guides/EXAMPLE-TEST-CONTRACT.md):
1. **Strict tsc** — `--strict --noUncheckedIndexedAccess --exactOptionalPropertyTypes --noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature` + 2 other hardening flags.
2. **Storyboard runner** — zero failed steps against the published storyboard.
3. **Façade gate** — every expected upstream route shows ≥1 hit at `/_debug/traffic` after the run.

Each gate fires for a distinct regression class. **Adversarially validate** by sabotaging one method (e.g. `cohorts: []` instead of `await upstream.listCohorts(…)`) and confirming the right gate fails — gate 1 catches type errors, gate 2 catches AdCP wire-shape regressions, gate 3 catches "wired the surface but didn't call upstream" façade regressions.

### 4. Skill update — fork-target pointer, NOT inline pattern

Update the per-specialism skill file (`skills/build-<role>-agent/SKILL.md` or `skills/build-<role>-agent/specialisms/<specialism>.md`) to:
- Open with a "**Fork target**: `examples/hello_<role>_adapter_<specialism>.ts`" pointer.
- Cover only this-specialism deltas: what's different from the role's baseline, which `RequiredPlatformsFor<S>` slot it fills, this-specialism storyboard's specific assertions.
- NOT teach the wire pattern inline. The example does that.

### 5. Add to the fork-target map + composition guide

- `examples/README.md` use-case → fork-target table gets a new row.
- `CLAUDE.md` `Specialism → Skill Index` table gets a new row.
- If the specialism is canonically claimed alongside others (e.g. `audience-sync` is often part of a `sales-social` bundle), update the multi-specialism composition guide.

### 6. Aspirational entrypoint in hello-cluster (optional)

If the specialism gets its own runnable example, add an entry to `examples/hello-cluster.ts` so the `npm run hello-cluster` orchestrator can boot it alongside other adapters.

## API Design Principles

When contributing to the library API:

### 1. **Developer Experience First**

- APIs should be intuitive and hard to misuse
- Provide sensible defaults
- Clear error messages with actionable advice

### 2. **Type Safety**

- Use TypeScript extensively
- Avoid `any` types
- Provide generic type parameters where helpful

### 3. **Protocol Agnostic**

- Library users shouldn't need to know about MCP vs A2A differences
- Hide protocol complexity behind clean abstractions
- Consistent error handling across protocols

### 4. **Performance Conscious**

- Avoid unnecessary object creation
- Use connection pooling where appropriate
- Implement timeouts and circuit breakers

### 5. **Security First**

- Validate all inputs
- Prevent SSRF attacks
- Handle authentication securely
- No secrets in logs

## Architecture Decisions

### Protocol Abstraction

The library provides protocol-agnostic APIs while supporting both MCP and A2A:

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Protocol-agnostic
const result = await client.callTool('agent-id', 'get_products', args);

// ❌ Avoid: Protocol-specific
const mcpResult = await mcpClient.callTool(args);
const a2aResult = await a2aClient.sendMessage(payload);
```

### Error Handling

Use consistent error handling patterns:

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Structured error responses
interface TestResult {
  success: boolean;
  data?: any;
  error?: string;
  debug_logs?: any[];
}

// ❌ Avoid: Throwing exceptions for expected failures
throw new Error('Agent returned no products');
```

### Configuration

Prefer environment-based configuration:

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Environment configuration
const agents = ConfigurationManager.loadAgentsFromEnv();

// ✅ Also good: Explicit configuration
const agents: AgentConfig[] = [{ id: 'test', ... }];

// ❌ Avoid: Hardcoded configuration
const agent = { agent_uri: 'https://hardcoded.example.com' };
```
