# AdCP Media Buy Protocol

This skill enables you to execute the AdCP Media Buy Protocol with sales agents. Use the standard MCP tools (`get_products`, `create_media_buy`, `sync_creatives`, etc.) exposed by the connected agent.

> **Buyer-side basics** — idempotency replay, `oneOf` variants, async `status:'submitted'` polling, error recovery from `adcp_error.issues[]` — live in `skills/call-adcp-agent/SKILL.md`. This skill covers per-task semantics only.

## Overview

> **3.2 preview:** Targeting-aware discovery fields are available only when the
> seller serves AdCP 3.2+ and the installed SDK exposes the 3.2 schema. Check
> `get_adcp_capabilities.adcp.supported_versions`, pin the selected release in
> `adcp_version`, and validate the echoed served release before sending them.
> A missing release-precision declaration, a 3.1-or-earlier result, or a
> major-only declaration is not evidence of support: omit the 3.2 fields and use
> legacy targeting filters or explicit brief prose. Do not probe by sending
> unknown fields because a legacy open schema may accept and ignore them. The public
> training agent will implement this flow after the 3.2 beta SDK release; until
> then use its legacy brief exercise and do not treat ignored unknown fields as
> acceptance.

The Media Buy Protocol provides these common standardized tasks:

| Task | Purpose | Response Time |
|------|---------|---------------|
| `list_products` | Read matching offers without seller curation | ~1-5s |
| `request_proposals` | Request seller-authored draft plans | ~60s or async |
| `refine_proposals` | Revise drafts or finalize unchanged terms into inventory holds | ~60s or async |
| `decline_proposals` | Record terminal buyer disposition | ~1-5s |
| `accept_proposal` | Accept a finalized proposal into a MediaBuy | Minutes-Days |
| `get_products` | Use the 3.x compatibility facade for discovery and proposals | ~60s |
| `get_adcp_capabilities` | See agent capabilities, supported protocols, and publisher properties | ~1s |
| `create_media_buy` | Create direct buys or use the 3.x proposal adapter | Minutes-Days |
| `update_media_buy` | Modify campaigns | Minutes-Days |
| `get_media_buys` | Retrieve campaign state and status | ~1-5s |
| `sync_creatives` | Upload creative assets | Minutes-Days |
| `sync_catalogs` | Sync product feeds and catalogs | Minutes-Days |
| `list_creatives` | Query creative library | ~1s |
| `get_media_buy_delivery` | Get performance data | ~60s |
| `provide_performance_feedback` | Share outcomes with publishers | ~1-5s |

## Typical Workflow

1. **Discover products**: use `list_products`, or `request_proposals` with a brief
2. **Verify the offer**: inspect formats, pricing, forecast, `overlay_support`, and any `targeting_resolution`
3. **Negotiate and hold**: revise a draft as needed, then finalize it without changing terms
4. **Accept or decline**: call `accept_proposal` for the held snapshot or `decline_proposals` when the buyer stops pursuing it
5. **Upload creatives**: use `sync_creatives` to add creative assets
6. **Monitor delivery**: use `get_media_buy_delivery` to track performance

## Canonical formats (AdCP 3.2)

Products carry `format_options[]`: a list of `ProductFormatDeclaration` entries describing the creative shapes the product accepts. Each declaration carries:

- `format_kind` — one of the 12 canonicals: `image`, `html5`, `display_tag`, `image_carousel`, `video_hosted`, `video_vast`, `audio_hosted`, `audio_daast`, `sponsored_placement`, `native_in_feed`, `responsive_creative`, or `agent_placement`; use `custom` only with `format_shape` and `format_schema`
- `params` — per-canonical parameters narrowing the format (dimensions, durations, codecs, char limits, CTA enums)
- Optional `format_option_id` — disambiguates product options and identifies publisher-catalog declarations when paired with `publisher_domain`
- Optional `v1_format_ref: [{agent_url, id}]` — array linking this v2 declaration to one or more v1 named formats (for dual emission during the v1↔v2 migration). Multi-size declarations should carry one ref per size
- Optional `seller_preference: "preferred" | "accepted" | "discouraged"` — soft routing hint when a multi-format product has several options at the same price

**Multi-format products.** A flexible publisher slot is one product with N format_options entries — e.g., Pinnacle Media's homepage accepts image OR html5 OR display_tag at multiple sizes via three format_options, one per type. Buyer picks the creative type they ship.

**Size flexibility.** Display canonicals (image / html5 / display_tag) declare size in one of three modes: fixed (`width`+`height`), multi-size (`sizes: [{w,h}]` — mirrors OpenRTB `banner.format[]`), or responsive (`min_width`/`max_width`/`min_height`/`max_height`). Modes are mutually exclusive.

**Discovering publisher catalogs.** Call `GET https://agenticadvertising.org/api/registry/publisher?domain=<publisher_domain>` for publisher-origin → AgenticAdvertising.org community-catalog → fail-closed resolution and provenance. Add `&include=placements` for provenance-labeled placement summaries with resolved canonical format options. The lookup's top-level `formats[]` remains a lossy display summary; fetch the returned raw registry or hosting URL when you need custom schema fields or other omitted declaration fields. Do not infer publisher authority from a seller's product catalog. Seller-specific deliverability comes from that seller's `Product.format_options[]`.

**Conversion tracking lives elsewhere.** Pixel-firing, conversion events, and attribution belong on `sync_event_sources` / `event_log` (campaign-scoped), NOT on creative format declarations. Sending `pixel_id` in `platform_extensions` on a format is a category error.

**Error codes specific to canonical formats.** `FORMAT_PROJECTION_FAILED`, `FORMAT_DECLARATION_DIVERGENT`, `FORMAT_DECLARATION_V1_AMBIGUOUS`, `FORMAT_CAPABILITY_UNRESOLVED`, `FORMAT_DECLARATION_V1_LOSSY_MULTI_SIZE` — all non-fatal advisories surfaced via the response `errors[]` array. See `static/schemas/source/enums/error-code.json` for full recovery semantics.

See `docs/creative/canonical-formats.mdx` for the full vocabulary, narrowing rules, and worked examples.

## Task Reference

### get_products

Discover buyable product configurations. Choose each request surface by what it
means:

- `brief`: goals, context, semantic audience intent, preferences, and
  requirements without a structured representation.
- `filters`: hard offer filters such as metadata, dates, budget, availability,
  commercial fit, and reporting support. They decide which products may be
  returned and apply in `brief`, `wholesale`, and `refine`.
- `targeting_overlay`: exact delivery constraints known now. Use this for
  countries, ages, placements, properties, collections, and other typed
  targeting so availability, price, and forecast already reflect them.
- `required_overlay_support`: targeting dimensions whose values will be chosen
  independently on packages later. This requests capability, not one product
  per value.

Prefer a structured field whenever one exists. It uses fewer tokens, is applied
by code, and avoids lossy inference. Explicit hard targeting written only in a
brief is still binding; when a seller extracts a structured predicate from
prose that materially affects eligibility, pricing, or forecasting, require one response-level confirmation in
`GetProductsResponse.targeting_resolution.brief_targeting`.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "buying_mode": "brief",
  "brief": "Premium video for a developer-tool launch; prioritize engineering and open-source contexts",
  "brand": {
    "domain": "example.com"
  },
  "filters": {
    "channels": ["olv", "ctv"],
    "delivery_type": "guaranteed",
    "pricing_currencies": ["USD"]
  },
  "targeting_overlay": {
    "geo_countries": ["US"],
    "demographics": {
      "age": { "min": 18, "max": 44, "include_unknown": false }
    }
  },
  "required_overlay_support": {
    "geo_metros": { "systems": ["nielsen_dma"] }
  }
}
```

**Key fields:**
- `buying_mode` (string): `"brief"`, `"wholesale"`, or `"refine"`
- `brief` (string): Natural-language curation input; hard statements remain requirements
- `brand` (object): Brand identity - `{ "domain": "acmecorp.com" }`
- `filters` (object, optional): Hard offer filters that decide which products may be returned
- `targeting_overlay` (object, optional): Concrete targeting applied during discovery and carried into purchase
- `required_overlay_support` (object, optional): Dimensions the product must allow packages to select later

**Response contains:**

- `products`: Array of matching products with `product_id`, `name`, `description`, `pricing_options`
- Each product includes canonical `format_options[]` and targeting capabilities
- `overlay_support`: binding product-scoped dimensions selectable later
- `targeting_resolution.modifications`: sparse differences from the requested structured overlay; selecting the product accepts them
- Response `targeting_resolution.brief_targeting`: the seller's single structured interpretation of hard targeting inferred from prose
- No `targeting_resolution` means exact acceptance of the structured overlay only; it does not prove how prose was interpreted

Treat `product_id` as the opaque identity of this configured offer. Keep it
within the same discovery/refinement context and purchase it before
`expires_at`; do not assume it is a permanent cross-session ID.

---

### create_media_buy

Create an advertising campaign from selected products.

**Request:**

```json
{

**Request:**

```json
{
  "creatives": [
    {
      "creative_id": "hero_video_30s",
      "name": "Brand Hero Video",
      "format_kind": "video_hosted",
      "format_option_ref": {
        "scope": "product",

{
  "filters": {
    "status": ["active"]
  },
  "limit": 20
}
```

---

### get_media_buys

Retrieve media buy state: status, valid_actions, creative approvals, pending formats, and optional delivery snapshots or revision history.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "media_buy_ids": ["mb_abc123"],
  "include_snapshot": true,
  "include_history": 5
}
```

**Key fields:**

- `media_buy_ids` (array, optional): Specific media buy IDs to retrieve
- `account` (object, optional): Filter to a specific account
- `status_filter` (string or array, optional): Filter by status — `pending_creatives`, `pending_start`, `active`, `paused`, `completed`, `rejected`, `canceled`. Defaults to `["active"]` when no IDs provided.
- `include_snapshot` (boolean, optional): Include near-real-time delivery snapshots per package
- `include_history` (integer, optional): Include the last N revision history entries per media buy

**Response contains:**

- `media_buys`: Array with `media_buy_id`, `status`, `valid_actions`, `packages`, creative approval state
- Optional `snapshot` per package (impressions, spend, pacing)
- Optional `history` entries (revision, timestamp, actor, action, summary)

#### Relationship-scoped indicators

Before querying indicators, read `get_adcp_capabilities.media_buy.supported_indicator_types`. Indicators may appear at three levels:

- buy: `get_media_buys.media_buys[]` (`budget_constrained`)
- package: `packages[]` (`creative_diversity_low`, `audience_saturation`, `inventory_shortfall_forecast`, `pacing_risk`, `budget_constrained`)
- assignment: `creative_approvals[]` and the matching `list_creatives.assignments.assigned_packages[]` (`creative_fatigue`, `creative_quality_opportunity`)

`indicators` omitted means unknown. A present array requires `indicator_types_evaluated` and `indicators_as_of`; empty means clear only for those named types and coverage. `scope` narrows an assertion; `indicators_evaluated_scope` declares partial publisher/placement coverage. Creative-library sellers advertise `list_creatives` in `relationship_notifications.projection_tasks`; those sellers include `media_buy_id`, approval state, and any `approval_scopes` on every reverse assignment row. Every seller repairs through `get_media_buys`.

For portfolio discovery, call `list_creatives` with `filters.indicator_types`, `include_assignments: true`, `assignment_projection: "matching"`, a bounded `assignment_limit`, `fields: ["creative_id", "assignments"]`, and cursor pagination. The seller still returns the released required creative envelope; `fields` limits optional payload. Check `assignments_truncated`; use `get_media_buys` for complete repair. Key evaluated state by seller + `media_buy_id` + `package_id` + `creative_id` + type + normalized placement scope.

Never clear from filtered disappearance or failure. Reread directly without `indicator_types`; clear only a named evaluated type in covered scope from a strictly newer snapshot. Equal-timestamp conflicts are no-ops. Direct assignment deletion retires its keys.

Indicator polling through `get_media_buys` does not require webhooks. Sellers may additionally declare `indicators.changed` and may independently declare `creative.assignment_changed`; creative-library sellers may advertise the bounded `list_creatives` reverse projection. Subscriptions are prospective, so establish a complete `get_media_buys` baseline after activation by enumerating known IDs or requesting every media-buy status and exhausting pagination, without `indicator_types`. Verify, dedupe, and reread `get_media_buys`; webhook payloads are invalidations, not state. Timestamp-only reevaluation does not fire, while material in-place creative updates invalidate prior assignment evaluations. Root `warnings[]` on completed `buy_products`, `accept_proposal`, or `control_media_buy` calls are immediate receipts; `create_media_buy` and `update_media_buy` facades mirror them. Inventory and pacing warning codes require the matching advertised durable indicator type.

---

### provide_performance_feedback

Submit one compact optimizer-ready assertion. Measurement agents call a buyer-controlled orchestrator gateway; the orchestrator authenticates and normalizes provider output, then calls each seller under the buyer's identity. Measurement providers do not receive seller-account grants.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "idempotency_key": "feedback-mb-abc123-2025-01-final",
  "media_buy_id": "mb_abc123",
  "measurement_period": {
    "start": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "end": "2025-01-31T23:59:59Z"
  },
  "performance_index": 1.2,
  "baseline": "campaign_target",
  "metric": {
    "scope": "standard",
    "metric_id": "conversions"
  },
  "producer": { "domain": "pinnacle-measurement.example" },
  "methodology": "deterministic_attribution",
  "final": true
}
```

**Key fields:**

- `idempotency_key` (string, required): Stable key for this logical assertion; retries reuse the same key and payload
- `media_buy_id` (string, required): Publisher's media buy identifier
- `measurement_period` (object, required): Time period with `start` and `end` (ISO 8601)
- `performance_index` (number, required): Normalized score — 1.0 equals `baseline`, lower underperforms, higher outperforms. Use observed/baseline for higher-is-better ratios and baseline/observed for lower-is-better ratios such as CPA.
- `baseline` (string, required for compact-contract producers): `campaign_target`, `control_group`, `seller_history`, `buyer_portfolio`, `market_benchmark`, or `other`
- `package_id` (string, optional): Specific package for package-level feedback
- `creative_id` (string, optional): Specific creative for creative-level feedback
- `metric` (object, optional): Standard/vendor metric identity; preferred over deprecated `metric_type`
- `producer` (BrandRef, conditionally required): Measurement provider that produced the analysis; required when `methodology` or `methodology_version` is present. The orchestrator verifies it against provider identity before preserving it on seller submissions
- `methodology`, `methodology_version` (string, optional): Provider-scoped open identifiers
- `study_ref` (string, optional): Opaque correlation reference, never an experiment-execution instruction
- `evidence` / `evidence_ref` (optional): Small inline summary and provider-hosted detail
- `final`, `as_of`, `supersedes_feedback_id` (optional): Maturation and immutable revision fields

Sellers declaring `media_buy.performance_feedback` also list `measurement.core` in top-level `experimental_features` and return `feedback_id`. When `reports_application_status` is true, inspect `application_status`: `accepted` is not an application claim; `applied` means the signal entered optimizer inputs; `not_applied` includes a reason. Do not confuse this with the response envelope's task `status`.

Do not send raw measurement datasets through this task or through `report_usage`. In the first gateway tier the provider reads delivery through the orchestrator's `get_media_buy_delivery` task and returns only the compact decision signal through `provide_performance_feedback`.

### get_media_buy_delivery

Retrieve performance metrics for a campaign.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "media_buy_id": "mb_abc123",
  "granularity": "daily",
  "date_range": {
    "start": "2024-01-01",
    "end": "2024-01-31"
  }
}
```

**Response contains:**

- `delivery`: Aggregated metrics (impressions, spend, clicks, etc.)
- `by_package`: Breakdown by package
- `timeseries`: Data points over time if granularity specified

---

## Key Concepts

### Brand identity

Brand context is provided by domain reference:

```json
{
  "brand": {
    "domain": "acmecorp.com"
  }
}
```

The agent resolves the domain to retrieve the brand's identity (name, colors, guidelines, etc.) from its `brand.json` file.

### Canonical format options

Products declare their closed accepted set directly:

```json
{
  "format_option_id": "display_image_300x250",
  "format_kind": "image",
  "params": { "width": 300, "height": 250 }
}
```

Buyers select the option with `format_option_refs[]` on the package and submit a manifest using `format_kind` plus `format_option_ref`. Compound named format IDs are deprecated in 3.2.

### Pricing Options

Products include `pricing_options` array. Each option has:

- `pricing_option_id`: Use this in `create_media_buy`
- `pricing_model`: "cpm", "cpm-auction", "flat-fee", etc.
- `price`: Base price (for fixed pricing)
- `floor`: Minimum bid (for auction)

For auction pricing, include `bid_price` in your package.

### Asynchronous Operations

Operations like `create_media_buy` and `sync_creatives` may require human approval. The response includes:

- `status: "pending"` - Operation awaiting approval
- `task_id` - For tracking async progress

Poll or use webhooks to check completion status.

---

## Error Handling

Common error patterns:

- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid parameters - check required fields
- **401 Unauthorized**: Invalid or missing authentication token
- **404 Not Found**: Invalid product_id, media_buy_id, or creative_id
- **422 Validation Error**: Schema validation failure - check field types

Error responses include:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
      "message": "budget must be greater than 0",
      "field": "packages[0].budget"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Testing Mode

Use **sandbox mode** for testing without real transactions. Sandbox is account-level — once a request references a sandbox account, the entire request is treated as sandbox with no real platform calls or spend.

Check whether the agent supports sandbox via `get_adcp_capabilities`:

```json
{
  "account": {
    "sandbox": true
  }
}
```

To enter sandbox mode, set `sandbox: true` on the account reference:

```json
{
  "account": {
    "brand": { "domain": "acme-corp.com" },
    "operator": "acme-corp.com",
    "sandbox": true
  }
}
```

Some sync tasks (`sync_creatives`, `sync_catalogs`) also support a `dry_run` parameter that previews changes without applying them. This is orthogonal to sandbox — you can use `dry_run` in both sandbox and production accounts.

See [Sandbox mode](https://docs.adcontextprotocol.org/docs/media-buy/advanced-topics/sandbox) for full details.
